    additional info about the image

    <!-- 
    3 rules to know when working with images:
      1. Save images in right format 
         1.1. PNG (Portable Network Graphics)(Less Colors,logos,transparency support)
         1.2. Jpeg (Majority colors,selfies)
         1.3. SVG (Scalable Netwrok Graphics) (Different sizes of pictures as each picture contains color and zoom increases number of pixels)
         1.4. GIF (Animated Pics)
      2. Save images in right size (as huge files will slow down the web site)
      3. Use the correct resolution (Clearity of image)
