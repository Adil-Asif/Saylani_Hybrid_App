        Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
        numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
        a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
        where each point needs to be identified by a section
        number.

        Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
        (rather than characters that indicate order).

        Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
        definitions for each of those terms.
