<!-- 
    Server: A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services,
     or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network.
     An individual system can provide resources and use them from another system at the same time. 
     This means that a device could be both a server and a client at the same time. 
-->
<!-- 
    Action: Every <form> element requires an action attribute. Its value
            is the URL for the page on the server that will receive the
            information in the form when it is submitted.
    Method: Forms can be sent using one of two methods:
            1) Get:the values from the form are added to the end of the URL specified in
                   the action attribute. The get method is ideal for:
                      ● short forms (such as search boxes)
                      ● when you are just retrieving data from the web server 
                       (not sending information that should be added to or 
                       deleted from a database) or post.
            2) Post: With the post method the values are sent in what are known as HTTP headers. #
                     As a rule of thumb you should use the post method if your form:
                      ● allows users to upload a file
                      ● is very long contains sensitive data (e.g. passwords)
                      ● adds information to, or deletes information from, a database
